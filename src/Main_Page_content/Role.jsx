          As a frontend developer, I'm most excited about creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces that provide a seamless user experience. I love the challenge of turning complex design concepts into responsive and interactive web applications using my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I enjoy working with MySQL to ensure that the data layer supports the frontend efficiently. The combination of crafting beautiful frontends and ensuring they are powered by robust databases is what truly drives my passion in this field.

          My projects include an Online Notes Sharing Website using Python, Django, SQL, HTML, CSS, and PHP, and a Final Year Project titled "Minutes of Meeting" using the same technologies. Additionally, I developed an E-Commerce Website similar to Flipkart using React JS, MongoDB, NodeJS, HTML, and CSS. The project involved creating a responsive design to ensure optimal user experience across devices. I built the e-commerce front-end to display products, a product cart, and a login/registration page using React JS. The back-end was developed using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB, where I created APIs for adding, displaying, and updating products, managing cart items, and handling user authentication. An admin panel was also implemented for product management.
